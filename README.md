# DeviceClinic

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is my first Flutter project.

A resource if this is your first Flutter project:
[Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
